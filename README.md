# Seen -> Violently rejected

Changes the "Seen [time]" message on Facebook chats to "Violently rejected
[time]." Because if they haven't replied, they're 
[probably rejecting you](http://www.dailycal.org/2014/02/07/breeding-tech-elite/).

This is a Chrome port of [the Firefox addon](https://github.com/achalddave/Seen-Rejected)
